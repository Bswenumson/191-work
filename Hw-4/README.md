# Animation
### Brooke Swenumson

This assignment to create an animated piece was initially very confusing.  I knew I wanted to have the color changing background, or element, but I had to go back and re-type out the lesson examples to orient myself to the work.

### Process

I started by creating the background. I then proceed to make the multi-triangle shape that is mapped to the mouse.  Finally I created the falling circles.

### Problems

After I started to figure out the color transitions in the triangle I felt I was ready to make the circles fall. However, this process was confusing. I am still not %100 on the 'if' commands. I imagine with a lot more practice it will become more transparent.

### Breakthroughs

Figuring out the right number to enter for the modulo to reset felt good.  At first it kept cutting off some of my slower / lower y value circles.

### Results

This ended up working out fairly well. I don't think it is the most exciting thing I have ever made, but it helps me  better understand some of the principles of coding.

### Future work

The thing I want to learn that would add to this for the future is creating some sort of 'phobic' area mapped to the mouse shape. If I could move the mouse around and elements in the piece would move away from it... kind of like opposite sides of a magnet.

### Conclusion

I am satisfied with what I have learned for this lesson, but I know I still need to work at grasping some of the more confusing codes.
